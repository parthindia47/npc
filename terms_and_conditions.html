			      <h3>THE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES</h3>
            <p>
            Fibonacci Network Wallet is software that (a) generates Wallet addresses and encrypted private keys that you may 
            use to send and receive Fibonacci Network Token and other cryptographically secured tokens (the “Virtual Currency”); 
            and (b) facilitates the submission of Virtual Currency transaction data to Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain-based 
            blockchains (the “Ethereum and Binance Networks”) without requiring you to download or install the associated 
            Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain-based software to your local device. An encrypted backup of certain information 
            associated with the Wallet can be stored on your device in Keystore JSON format. The private key is connected to 
            the Wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency to and from that 
            Wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic 
            (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. You must keep your Wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, 
            and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency 
            associated with the Wallet. Fibonacci Network Wallet cannot assist with password retrieval. Fibonacci Network Wallet 
            stores your Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated 
            with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password 
            for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of 
            any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency 
            you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password. 
            Virtual Currency Transactions in order to be completed, must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency’s 
            associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent 
            third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the Ethereum Networks and 
            Binance Smart Chain Network and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that 
            you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using Fibonacci Network Wallet, 
            you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, 
            or may be substantially delayed, by the Ethereum Network and Binance Smart Chain Network. 
            Fibonacci Network Wallet does store or Virtual Currency. We do store, send, or receive Virtual Currency. 
            Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the Ethereum-based blockchains and Binance Smart Chain 
            and not on a network owned by us. We therefore do not guarantee that Fibonacci Network Wallet can affect the transfer 
            of title or right in any Virtual Currency. All due care will be taken to securely store the Virtual Currency of the users 
            but in case of unforeseeable circumstances Fibonacci Network will not be responsible to any user for any loss. 
            Accuracy of Information Provided by User. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the 
            Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or 
            omissions that you make in connection with any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Services. 
            We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Virtual Currency.

			      <h3>WALLET REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
              <u>Registration:-</u> You must create a Wallet in order to use Fibonacci Network Wallet. 
              When you create a Wallet, you will be assigned a private key. You will be fully responsible 
              for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us 
              of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any other breach of security. We will 
              not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph. 
              When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss 
              of access to and/or control over your Wallet. Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, 
              the following: (a) creating a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online 
              service; (b) using the backup functionality provided by the Wallet or safeguard your  mnemonic (backup) 
              phrase on an external hard drive which, all users, especially users who have more than 50,000 INR  in assets, 
              are encouraged to do even if they are utilizing the Services’ backup functionality; (c) maintaining the 
              security of your Wallet by protecting the  mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet by, 
              for example, limiting access to your computer and your Wallet; and (d) promptly notifying us if you 
              discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>Push Notifications:- </u>
              You may agree to receive push notifications from Fibonacci Network Wallet that will alert you when 
              Ethereum-based blockchains and Binance Smart Chain Based Blockchains are congested and when transactions 
              involving your Wallet have been completed. Push notifications can be enabled to display information about 
              Token Launches. For better experience of the users push notifications will be allowed by default but you 
              can opt out to the service by accessing “Settings” and disabling “Push Notifications”. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>Payment and Fees:- </u>
              Fibonacci Network Wallet does not currently charge any fees for any of its Services. However, we reserve the 
              right to do so in the future and, in such case, any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any 
              service to which a fee applies. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>Transactions:- </u>
              Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify 
              your transaction. Fibonacci Network Wallet has no control over any Ethereum-based blockchain and Binance Smart Chain 
              Blockchain and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You must ensure 
              that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. 
              You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas 
              associated with your Fibonacci Network Wallet account. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>Taxes:-</u>
              It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted 
              transaction details for via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax 
              to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply 
              to your Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain-based transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, 
              or remitting any taxes arising from any Virtual Currency-related transactions.
