			<h3> 2. Platform & Ecosystem </h3>
            <p>
			Fibonacci Network Token, powering Fiyou, will give digital content creators and viewers the ability to interact in a new and innovative way. 
			We anticipate that by 2025 image & video sharing apps, discussion apps, and online social-gaming landscape will not be dominated by apps that 
			have the biggest pool of users, content creators and active discussion forums, but by those universal apps which can successfully provide a 
			one-stop solution for every need of the users. 
            </p>
            <p>
			Fiyou, will be an efficient universal social-media platform that will be capable of providing users with the luxury of having a single gateway 
			to the world of social media with the help of blockchain technology. Our token FIBO will be the rocket fuel for powering the Fiyou platform, 
			with FIBO viewers can reward the content creators and this will provide content creators with a much advanced andbetter way to monetize their audience. 
			Also, in online-social games, FIBO will create a healthy competitive atmosphere where the winner will get FIBO in the reward which he will be 
			able to use anywhere on the platform. Moreover, in phase 4 of our project we will also be having an FIBO exchange marketplace on the platform 
			where any user can swap FIBO with BTC, ETH, BNB, and USDT.

			<h3> 5. TECHNOLOGY</h3>

<li> <b> What is Binance Smart Chain? </b></li>

<p>
Binance Smart Chain is an innovative solution to bring programmability and interoperability to Binance Chain. 
Binance Smart Chain relies on a system of 21 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support 
short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. 
The double-sign detection and other slashing logic guarantee security, stability, and chain finality.
</p>

<p>
Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is best described as a blockchain that runs in parallel to the Binance Chain. 
Unlike Binance Chain, BSC boasts smart contract functionality and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
The design goal here was to leave the high throughput of Binance Chain intact while introducing smart contracts into its ecosystem. 
Because BSC is EVM-compatible, it launched with support for the rich universe of Ethereum tools and DApps.

<li> <b> What is the BEP-20 Token Standard? </b></li>
<p>
BEP-20 is a token standard on Binance Smart Chain that extends ERC-20, the most common Ethereum token standard. 
You can think of it as a blueprint for tokens that defines how they can be spent, who can spend them, and other rules for their usage. 
Due to its similarity to Binance Chain's BEP-2 and Ethereum's ERC-20, it's compatible with both. BEP-20 was conceived 
as a technical specification for Binance Smart Chain, with the goal of providing a flexible format for developers to 
launch a range of different tokens. These could represent anything from shares in a business to dollars stored 
in a bank vault (i.e., a stablecoin). Of course, one could equally create a native asset as a BEP-20 token, or even peg tokens 
from other blockchains to make them usable on Binance Smart Chain. This is what's done with "Peggy" coins, which are essentially 
BEP-20 versions of other crypto assets (such as LINK or XRP). Like BEP-2 tokens on Binance Chain, BEP-20 token transfers are fuelled with BNB. 
This provides an incentive for validators to include the transactions in the blockchain, as they'll collect the BNB as a fee for their troubles. 
You may know that Binance Smart Chain was envisioned as something of an extension to Binance Chain. With dual chain architecture, 
both chains are complementary - Binance Smart Chain caters to decentralized applications without congesting the original chain, which is optimized for ultra-fast trading.

<li> <b> Why binance smart chain? </b> </li>


<ul>
    <li> 
	We, at the Fibonacci Network, have a deep faith in the spirit of open-source development, and in past have been contributing 
	actively to the development of open-source communities, so BSC's idea resonates with our thinking.
	</li>
	
    <li>This is one of the fastest exploding ecosystems which makes it a better choice for the development of our platform.</li>
	
    <li> BSC provides lower gas fees in comparison to Ethereum. Lower gas fees can promote mass holding and adoption of FIBO. In comparison to Ethereum,
	gas fees on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) isalmost 20 times lower.
	</li>
	
	<li> Binance Smart Chain or BSC utilizes Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus. 
	The algorithm uses 21 validators and is capable of producing a new block every 3 seconds which makes it a suitable choice for mass adoption.
	</li>

    <li> BSC has a track record that speaks for itself as many leading tokens are working on it. This makes it a smart choice for us. </li>

			<h3> 6. PROBLEMS </h3>
            <p><b>Viewers can only watch. They can't demand the custom content they want from content creators.</b></p>
			<p>The current social networking, image and video sharing environment don't offer much choice to viewers to decide the 
			content they want to see rather they have to be dependent on what content the creator serves them. 
			This is a passive endeavour as the viewers have no direct influence over their favourite content creators. 
			Ironically, the current online-social gaming arena lacks an element of social connection among the players as 
			they usually don't get the option to keep interacting with each other over voice or video while playing.</p>

			<p>This means that in the present state of social media there is no system to make sure that a viewer can compulsorily 
			get content-on-demand from her favourite creator. Moreover, there is also no prevalent mechanism in place to make sure
			that content creator where content creator can monetize content-on-demand from viewers. </p>
